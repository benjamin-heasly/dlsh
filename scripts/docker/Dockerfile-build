# This Dockerfile was helpful for building and packaging dlsh.
# Docker gives a clean environment, meaning the steps below must account for all dependencies.
# Docker also gives us a local environment that's easy to iterate on.
# Getting this working was the basis for the automated CI builds, over in .github/workflows/.
#
# To run this docker build cd to the dlsh repo root and:
#
#   docker build . -f scripts/docker/Dockerfile-build -t dlsh-build:local
#
# To sanity check the libs and headers that are ready for packaging:
#
#   docker run --rm -ti dlsh-build:local dpkg-deb --info dlsh_0.0.0_amd64.deb
#   docker run --rm -ti dlsh-build:local dpkg-deb --contents  dlsh_0.0.0_amd64.deb
